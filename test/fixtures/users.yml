# Read about fixtures at http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/FixtureSet.html

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
# This model initially had no columns defined.  If you add columns to the
# model remove the '{}' from the fixture names and add the columns immediately
# below each fixture, per the syntax in the comments below
#
one: {}
# column: value
#
two: {}
#  column: value
=======
one:
  name: MyString
  email: MyString
  password_digest: MyString
  remember_token: MyString

two:
  name: MyString
  email: MyString
  password_digest: MyString
  remember_token: MyString
